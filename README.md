# A geoserver docker image

This Dockerfile can be used to create images for all geoserver versions since 2.5.

* Debian based Linux
* OpenJDK 11
* Tomcat 9
* GeoServer
  * Support of custom fonts (e.g. for SLD styling)
  * CORS support
  * Support extensions
  * Support community extensions
  * Support additional libraries

## How to Use

### How to run official release?

To pull an official image use ``docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:{{VERSION}}``, e.g.:

```shell
docker pull docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.22.0
```

Afterwards you can run the pulled image locally with:

```shell
docker run -it -p 80:8080 docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.22.0
```

Or if you want to start the container daemonized, use e.g.:

```shell
docker run -d -p 80:8080 docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.22.0
```

Check <http://localhost/geoserver> to see the geoserver page,
and login with geoserver default `admin:geoserver` credentials.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Please change the default ``geoserver`` and ``master`` passwords.

For more information see the user-guide [docker installation instructions](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/installation/docker.html).

### How to mount an external folder for use as a data directory

To use an external folder as your geoserver data directory.

```shell
docker run -it -p 80:8080 \
  --mount src="/absolute/path/on/host",target=/opt/geoserver_data/,type=bind \
  docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.22.0
```

An empty data directory will be populated on first use. You can easily update GeoServer while
using the same data directory.

### How to start a GeoServer without sample data?

This image populates ``/opt/geoserver_data/`` with demo data by default. For production scenarios this is typically not desired.

The environment variable `SKIP_DEMO_DATA` can be set to `true` to create an empty data directory.

```shell
docker run -it -p 80:8080 \
  --env SKIP_DEMO_DATA=true \
  docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.22.0
```

### How to issue a redirect from the root ("/") to GeoServer web interface ("/geoserver/web")?

By default, the ROOT webapp is not available which makes requests to the root endpoint "/" return a 404 error.
The environment variable `ROOT_WEBAPP_REDIRECT` can be set to `true` to issue a permanent redirect to the web interface.

### How to download and install additional extensions on startup?

The ``startup.sh`` script allows some customization on startup:

* ``INSTALL_EXTENSIONS`` to ``true`` to download and install extensions
* ``STABLE_EXTENSIONS`` list of extensions to download and install
* ``CORS_ENABLED``

Example installing wps and ysld extensions:

```shell
docker run -it -p 80:8080 \
  --env INSTALL_EXTENSIONS=true --env STABLE_EXTENSIONS="wps,ysld" \
  docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.22.0
```

The list of extensions (taken from SourceForge download page):

```shell
app-schema   gdal            jp2k          ogr-wps          web-resource
authkey      geofence        libjpeg-turbo oracle           wmts-multi-dimensional
cas          geofence-server mapml         params-extractor wps-cluster-hazelcast
charts       geopkg-output   mbstyle       printing         wps-cluster-hazelcast
control-flow grib            mongodb       pyramid          wps-download
css          gwc-s3          monitor       querylayer       wps-jdbc
csw          h2              mysql         sldservice       wps
db2          imagemap        netcdf-out    sqlserver        xslt
dxf          importer        netcdf        vectortiles      ysld
excel        inspire         ogr-wfs       wcs2_0-eo
```

### How to install additional extensions from local folder?

If you want to add geoserver extensions/libs, place the respective jar files in a directory and mount it like

```shell
docker run -it -p 80:8080 \
  --mount src="/dir/with/libs/on/host",target=/opt/additional_libs,type=bind \
  docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.22.0
```

### How to add additional fonts to the docker image (e.g. for SLD styling)?

If you want to add custom fonts (the base image only contains 26 fonts) by using a mount:

```shell
docker run -it -p 80:8080 \
  --mount src="/dir/with/fonts/on/host",target=/opt/additional_fonts,type=bind \
  docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.22.0
```

**Note:** Do not change the target value!

## Troubleshooting

### How to watch geoserver.log from host?

To watch ``geoserver.log`` of a running container:

```shell
docker exec -it {CONTAINER_ID} tail -f /opt/geoserver_data/logs/geoserver.log
```

### How to use the docker-compose demo?

The ``docker-compose-demo.yml`` to build with your own data directory and extensions.

Stage geoserver data directory contents into ``geoserver_data``, and any extensions into ``additional_libs`` folder.

Run ``docker-compose``:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose-demo.yml up --build
```

## How to Build?

### How to build a local image?

```shell
docker build -t {YOUR_TAG} .
```

### How to run local build?

After building run using local tag:

```shell
docker run -it -p 80:8080 {YOUR_TAG}
```

### How to build a specific GeoServer version?

```shell
docker build \
  --build-arg GS_VERSION={YOUR_VERSION} \
  -t {YOUR_TAG} .
```

### How to build with custom geoserver data directory?

```shell
docker build \
  --build-arg GS_DATA_PATH={RELATIVE_PATH_TO_YOUR_GS_DATA} \
  -t {YOUR_TAG} .
```

**Note:** The passed path **must not** be absolute! Instead, the path should be within the build context (e.g. next to the Dockerfile) and should be passed as a relative path, e.g. `GS_DATA_PATH=./my_data/`

### Can a build use a specific GeoServer version AND custom data?

Yes! Just pass the `--build-arg` param twice, e.g.

```shell
docker build \
  --build-arg GS_VERSION={VERSION} \
  --build-arg GS_DATA_PATH={PATH} \
  -t {YOUR_TAG} .
```

### How to build with additional libs/extensions/plugins?

Put your `*.jar` files (e.g. the WPS extension) in the `additional_libs` folder and build with one of the commands from above! (They will be copied to the GeoServer `WEB-INF/lib` folder during the build.)

**Note:** Similar to the GeoServer data path from above, you can also configure the path to the additional libraries by passing the `ADDITIONAL_LIBS_PATH` argument when building:

```shell
docker build \
  --build-arg ADDITIONAL_LIBS_PATH={RELATIVE_PATH_TO_YOUR_LIBS}
  -t {YOUR_TAG} .
```

## How to release?

### How to publish official release?

OSGeo maintains geoserver-docker.osgeo.org repository for publishing. The results are combined into docker.osgeo.org repository alongside other software such as PostGIS.

Build locally:

```shell
docker build -t geoserver-docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.22.0 .
```

Login using with osgeo user id:

```shell
docker login geoserver-docker.osgeo.org
```

Push to osgeo repository:

```shell
docker push geoserver-docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.22.0
```

### How to automate release?

For CI purposes, the script in the `build` folder is used to simplify those steps.

The variables `DOCKERUSER` and `DOCKERPASSWORD` have to be set with valid credentials before this script can push the image to the osgeo repo.

You need to pass the version as first and the type as second argument, where type has to be one of `build`, `publish` or `buildandpublish`.

Examples:

`./release.sh 2.22.1 build`

`./release.sh 2.22.0 publish`

`./release.sh 2.22.1 buildandpublish`
